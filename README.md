# OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision)

OpenCV is an open-source Python library designed for real-time appplications in processing (see) , analyzing (read), and understand visual data just like humans observe the outside World. 
Developed by Intel in 1999 and designed as a base or foundation in the AI ecosystem for handling the visual and data processing by providing functionality in several areas :
* Image Processing : Analyze the full scale pixels of an image/video for image manipulation including thresholding, filtering, resizing, rotating, and even for the colour conversion (BGR or grayscale).
* Feature Detection :  OpenCV also provided a tools for scanning any interesting data, such edges detection, color, and keyt-point. Utilizing these tools for any robot navigation, building 3D models from 2D images, and recognition and tracking of objects.
* Video Analyzing : Reading a video stream (real-time observation) for any task, such as face recognition or background subtraction.
